# tic_tac_toe_AI
A Tic Tac Toe AI is a program designed to play the game of Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, against a human opponent or another AI. The goal of the AI is to make optimal moves to either win the game or, if winning is not possible, to avoid losing.

Here's a general description of how a Tic Tac Toe AI works:-

Game Representation:- The AI needs to represent the Tic Tac Toe game board internally. This is typically done using a data structure such as a 3x3 grid, with each cell representing an empty space, a nought, or a cross.

Game State Evaluation:- The AI evaluates the current state of the game to determine the best move. It considers factors such as the positions of noughts and crosses on the board and assesses the potential outcomes of different moves.

Move Execution:- Once the AI has determined the best move, it places its symbol (nought or cross) on the board in the appropriate position.

Opponent Response:- If playing against a human or another AI, the opponent makes their move, and the AI repeats the evaluation and decision-making process to determine its next move.
My Contribution is I  created a apython code for this AI project. This project is totally AI based on Gaming Project
